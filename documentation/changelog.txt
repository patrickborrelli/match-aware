Issues:
need relationship between referee and referee assignor - DEFERRED
decide on and implement a security model for api paths - POSTPONED
add path to add staff to organization by ID
modify GETs to allow req.query, with specific params listed
move all asynchronous calls out of appDataLoad so they can be called by other controllers.
need scrolling on assign, request, and invite tabs
add filtering to list of pending invites
add default image to club logo
get teams by club
get rid of reschedule rules as a model and add those fields to league
add built in sort to all GET paths
add pretty text for all types, enums, etc
make league select for team creation a multiple select
edit dialog not populated with ng-model data even though it exists.
need to add intermission length to rules
add max roster to rules
add file selectors, figure out how to upload and add to app/images
change addon for field sizes to yards
missing ball size from add rule
method variable in facilityForm is being set properly in the $watch but not when the form is being submitted?
NEED FORM VALIDATION
no mechanism to add field sizes...likely add to field manager tools rather than club admin
need some way to reopen fields, view details of closures
add text field to closures
need to move closures out to their own collection to handle multiple scheduled closures for the same field and retain a closure history


Unresolved
=========================
Updating user roles dialog, must uncheck and recheck all current roles otherwise they are recorded as false
modify api, should token be nullified/deleted/inactivated on logout?
revisit bootstrap-select, installed on the wrong app
make club and user requred in REST API clubmember
ORGANIZATIONS not implemented

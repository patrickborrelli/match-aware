version 2.0
===========

changes to model 
=========================
CLOSURE no longer a part of FACILITY or FIELD, own separate entity.  Both FACILITY and FIELD have a collection of CLOSURES
CLUB_MEMBERSHIP no longer exists...CLUB_ROLE entity replaces it and ties user to club to role
array of MESSAGES added to ACCESS_REQUEST
added intermission_duration field to RULES




Issues
==========================
need relationship between referee and referee assignor
decide on and implement a security model for api paths - POSTPONED
need validation on all entry (preventing duplicate entries of users, - unique validation)
get teams by club
need to add smart cascading delete logic into API

ORGANIZATIONS not implemented
on authenticated user with no current club roles, make sure to display any pending access requests with the option of resending
okay dialog on registration success always closes itself
need scrolling on assign, request, and invite tabs
add filtering to list of pending invites
move all asynchronous calls out of appDataLoad so they can be called by other controllers.
add pretty text for all types, enums, etc
make league select for team creation a multiple select
edit dialog not populated with ng-model data even though it exists.
add file selectors, figure out how to upload and add to app/images
change addon for field sizes to yards
method variable in facilityForm is being set properly in the $watch but not when the form is being submitted?
no mechanism to add field sizes...likely add to field manager tools rather than club admin
NEED FORM VALIDATION
missing ball size from add rule
need some way to reopen fields, view details of closures




Unresolved Bugs
=========================
Updating user roles dialog, must uncheck and recheck all current roles otherwise they are recorded as false - possible solution, use root scope
revisit bootstrap-select, installed on the wrong app
